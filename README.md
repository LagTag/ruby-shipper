Shipping APIS in ruby
This Gem is a work in progress. Its intention is to combine as many shipping apis as possible into one Gem under some basic building blocks. All apis require similar information to ship, query for ratings, validate etc. Right now I am planning on adding Fedex, UPS, and USPS. Later on I may include some smaller apis like DHL(and the dozen apis they have), Landmark, Spring (Germany), etc
